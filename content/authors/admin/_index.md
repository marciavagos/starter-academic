I have recently obtained a PhD degree from the University of Oslo (Norway), undertaken
at Simula Research Laboratory,  within **computational modelling of **cardiac electrophysiology**.

Before that I worked at the Forschungszentrum Informatik, in Germany, where I developed a 3D model of the
human eye, and simulated retinal damage driven by laser irradiation.

I have an Integrated Masters degree in Bioengineering, with a specialization in Biomedical Engineering.
